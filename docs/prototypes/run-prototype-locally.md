# Run your prototype locally

Once you've created your prototype, run it to view it in the browser. This is how you access the Prototype Manager, and how you preview your work. 

## Before you start

* Open the command line in your prototype's root directory

## Run your prototype

1. In the command line, enter `npm run dev`. 
1. The prototype should now be running. To test this, go to the URL displayed in the command line (by default, this is `http://localhost:3000`)
1. When you're ready to stop your prototype, open the command line window again and type `stop`, or press Ctrl + C.
