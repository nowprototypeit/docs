# Introduction to variants

With Now Prototype It, you can create custom setup packages for your prototypes so that individual users don't have to configure a complex setup every time. These setup packages are called **Variants**. 

Variants can include specific configurations, tools, and libraries tailored to your needs.

Variants are particularly useful for teams that need to maintain consistency in their prototyping process.

This section describes how to use variants when you create prototypes, and how to create your own variants for others to use.
