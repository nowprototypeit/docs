# Applying styles and templates

You can use Now Prototype It to create prototypes that match your organisation's existing styles and templates. To do this, you can use **plugins**. You can create your own plugins, or use plugins that somebody else has created.

This section describes what plugins are, how to create them, and how to work with them. 

## How do I find out more about plugins?
