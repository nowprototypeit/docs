# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

Now Prototype It is an open-source project you can run on your computer/laptop as long as you have Node.js installed. This guide will help you set up the environment and install Now Prototype It.

If you can't install Node.js locally, please [contact support to discuss our hosted solution](mailto:support@nowprototype.it).

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

 - A supported version of Node.JS, currently versions 20 and 22.  Node.js can be downloaded from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
 - For the full functionality, you should also have Git installed, which can be downloaded from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Choosing a Variant

Using a variant is a great way to get started with Now Prototype It. Variants are pre-configured setups that include various features and tools to help you prototype quickly.

If your organisation has a variant you can specify it when creating a new prototype. If your organisation does not have a variant, you can use the default variant, which includes essential features like Nunjucks templating, SASS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

You can find more information about creating variants in the [Variants documentation](/create-a-plugin/variants).
