# Variants

Variants are a powerful feature of Now Prototype It that allow you to create custom setups for your prototypes. They can include specific configurations, tools, and libraries tailored to your needs.

Custom variants ensure that individual users don't have to configure a complex setup every time. This is particularly useful for groups that want to maintain consistency in their prototyping process.

This section describes how to use variants when you create prototypes, and how to create your own variants for others to use.
