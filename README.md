# Now Prototype It Documentation

This is the repository for the documentation of Now Prototype It.

If you think the documentation could be clearer or more complete feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

The pages themselves are in the `views/url-based` directory, adding new `md` files will create new pages which will be available in the navigation menu.  `index.md` files will be used as the landing page for a section, but if there's no `index.md` an index page with navigation will be created automatically.
